# IRCTC_clone
A simple, fully client-side IRCTC (Indian Railways) portal clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project simulates the train ticket booking process, from search to seat selection and final ticket confirmation, and serves as an educational demo of a basic travel reservation workflow.
